# Retail-Customer-Behavior-RFM-Analysis
Customer behavior analysis and segmentation using RFM methodology with Python and Excel dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes retail customer transaction data to understand purchasing behavior and segment customers using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis. The goal is to identify high-value, loyal, and at-risk customers to support data-driven business decisions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess retail transaction data
- Perform RFM analysis using Python
- Segment customers based on purchasing behavior
- Build an interactive Excel dashboard for visualization

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and contains retail transaction records. Data cleaning and transformation were performed before analysis.

## 🧮 Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing using Python (Pandas)
2. Calculation of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics
3. RFM score assignment and customer segmentation
4. Export of processed data to Excel
5. Dashboard creation for business insights

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Microsoft Excel
- Kaggle Dataset
